What is Mycelium?
> Mycelium is a Spigot fork designed for hardcore PvP communities using legacy game versions. It's crafted for stability and performance through minimization, stripping away unnecessary vanilla functionality and incorporating upstream fixes and improvements from the current version of Spigot.

Why was Mycelium created?
> Mycelium was created to meet the demand for a stable and high-performing server solution for hardcore PvP servers still using legacy game and server versions, while addressing concerns about the proliferation of expensive closed source Spigot forks. By offering a free and optimized alternative, Mycelium ensures server stability isn't locked behind a paywall.
